 country_history_ARA: "The [GetCountry('ARA').GetLongName] stands proudly as a significant power in the western Mediterranean region thanks to its maritime prowess, diplomatic weight, and flourishing trade networks.\n\nThe stabilization of the Kingdom of [ShowLocationName('valencia')] and the ongoing conquest of the newly-created Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica might ensure it a dominant position in the seas. However, despite its relative stability, challenges loom on the horizon. To the East, the [GetCountry('MLL').GetLongName] faces economic difficulties and its ruler's animosity towards [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] might convince him to act foolishly. In the peninsula, the threat of the [GetCountry('CAS').GetLongName] is more and more real as the #italic Reconquista#! comes to an end. To the north, the [GetCountry('FRA').GetLongName] have consolidated their domain over the Languedoc in the last century.\n\nHow would the young [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetShortName] face the challenges to come? Will [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHeShe] focus on the Mediterranean Sea and rule the waves from [ShowLocationName('barcelona')] to the Holy Land? Will [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHeShe] turn around and claim dominance over Iberia? Or will [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHeShe] try to get revenge from the Battle of Muret in 1213, and recover its ancient holdings north of the Pyrenees?"

 country_history_AZT: "For the past two centuries, groups of [ShowCultureName('nahua_culture')] people descended from the Chichimec migrated to central Mexico from their legendary ancestral home, known as Aztlan. Our people were one of those wandering groups.\n\nAs with many other [ShowCultureNameWithNoTooltip('nahua_culture')] nations, we settled our own [ShowGovernmentReformName('altepetl')]. It was named [ShowLocationName('tenochtitlan')], and we built it over an artificial island in the heart of [ShowLocationName('texcoco_lake')]. Our most prominent figures were also influenced by the [ShowCultureName('toltec_culture')] culture, and we started to develop a refined civilization in the lagoon. We would also come to be recognized as prime fighters by our neighbors, as our equally refined warring skills make Aztec armies a force to be feared...\n\nHowever, we currently stand as vassals of the [ShowGovernmentReformNameWithNoTooltip('altepetl')] of [GetCountry('TEP').GetName], and our expansion possibilities are limited to the proximities of the lagoon they inhabit. Only an intelligent and capable leader can us in our journey to subdue the valley of Mexico and beyond."

 country_history_BOH: "The lands of [GetCountry('BOH').GetName] are a territory inhabited by Slavs in the heart of the Germanic [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetName]. After a long period under the [ShowDynastyName('premyslid_dynasty')] dynasty, the current [ShowDynastyName('luxembourg_dynasty')] rulers may tighten the ties the country has with the Empire, although [GetCountry('BOH').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] is more [ShowCultureName('french')] than [ShowCultureGroupName('german_group')], having been educated in the royal court of [ShowLocationName('paris')]. Keeping both the [GetCountry('BOH').GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and the common folk satisfied under a foreign [GetCountry('BOH').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], and navigating the political intricacies of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetNameWithNoTooltip] will prove a hurdle for anybody.

 country_history_BYZ: "Once a proud [GetCountry('BYZ').GetFlavorRank] that stretched from [ShowRegionName('egypt_region')] and the [ShowAreaName('levant_area')] to [ShowRegionName('iberia_region')] and [ShowRegionName('italy_region')], [GetCountry('BYZ').GetName] now faces a period of almost inexorable decline caused by the shock of the Fourth Crusade, even after the recovery of [ShowLocationName('constantinople')] by the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetDynasty.GetName]. During [GetCharacter('byz_andronikos_ii_palaiologos').GetHerHis] reign, [GetCharacter('byz_andronikos_ii_palaiologos').GetName] saw fit to dissolve several key institutions, such as the Navy, in an attempt to save the dying economy of the country, while the [ShowGovernmentReformName('theme_system')] continued to be a shadow of what it was, as the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetFlavorRank] lost territory across all fronts.\n\n[GetCharacter('byz_andronikos_ii_palaiologos').GetHerHis|U] successor, [GetCharacter('byz_andronikos_iii_palaiologos').GetName], is now faced with the difficult task of safeguarding what remains of our once-glorious [GetCountry('BYZ').GetFlavorRank]. To our east, [GetCountry('TUR').GetName] have started amassing a large army to wipe out our remaining holdings in [ShowRegionName('anatolia_region')], threatening to set foot across the straits. At the same time, [GetCharacter('ser_stefan_dusan').GetName] eyes [ShowLocationName('thessaloniki')] and [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('north_epirus_province')] like a vulture. Meanwhile, our treasury runs dry of precious coin, and the country may yet be thrown into a perilous civil war, as the family of our [GetCountry('BYZ').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] conspires with the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] behind closed doors."

 country_history_CAS: "The [GetCountry('CAS').GetLongName] was formed through the union of its two constituent parts, the Kingdom of [GetCountry('CAS').GetNameWithNoTooltip] and the [GetCountry('LON').GetLongName], when they were reunited after both titles were inherited by [GetCharacter('cas_fernando_iii_burgundy').GetName] in 1230. A century later, [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetName] rules without much opposition, having overcome a troubled start to his reign following the end of a long regency under his grandmother, [GetCharacter('cas_maria_molina').GetName].\n\nAfter being able to rein in the nobility of the realm, led by his relative [GetCharacter('cas_juan_manuel').GetName], and having stabilized the governance of the country, [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is now turning his attention to the southern border. The [GetCountry('GRA').GetLongName] continues to menace our country since the emirate became independent a century ago, backed by the powerful [GetCountry('MOR').GetLongName], which holds a foothold on Iberia through a petty kingdom centered on [ShowLocationName('algeciras')] and [ShowLocationName('ronda')], and held by [GetCharacter('mor_abu_malik_abd_al_wahid').GetName], son and heir of [GetCharacter('mor_abu_al_hasan_ali').GetName].\n\nHowever, these are not the only troubles for [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip], as his relationship with his beloved mistress, [GetCharacter('cas_leonor_guzman').GetName], and [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetHerHis] children by [GetCharacter('cas_leonor_guzman').GetHerHis] have eroded the relationship with the king's rightful wife, [GetCharacter('cas_maria_portugal').GetName], daughter of [GetCharacter('por_afonso_iv_portugal').GetName]. With the latter living apart from the king, this rift in the royal family now leaves the looming question of just who will succeed him when he passes.\n\nWill [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] and his successors be able to deal with these threats to the [GetCountry('CAS').GetLongNameWithNoTooltip], both at home and abroad?"
 
 country_history_CHA: "[GetCountry('CHA').GetName] is a collection of many different somewhat autonomous Cham polities which united into a single [GetCountry('CHA').GetFlavorRank]. As the single [ShowReligionAdjective('hindu')] state in mainland [ShowRegionName('indochina_region')], the people of the [GetCountry('CHA').GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] face constant threat from the decaying [GetCountry('KHM').GetLongName] to their west and the aggressive [GetCountry('DAI').GetLongName] to their north.\n\nDespite the external threats, the seafaring traditions of the [GetCountry('CHA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] people have allowed them to gain wealth through commerce and piracy in the seas of [ShowRegionName('indonesia_region')]."

 country_history_CHI: "Established by [GetCharacter('kublai_khan').GetName], the [GetCountry('CHI').GetLongName] now controls the vastness of a great [GetCountry('CHI').GetFlavorRank]. Having tamed [ShowSubContinentName('east_asia')] and under [GetCharacter('kublai_khan').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s great leadership, they managed to reach new heights of prestige and splendor. However, their influence over the subcontinent is waning... Internal strife, instability, and cultural friction have replaced what once was prosperous and magnificent. Those who wish to dethrone them and usurp their mandate are gathering their strength. Plotting and scheming within [GetCountry('CHI').GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s borders, they seek to find weakness within the [GetCountry('CHI').GetFlavorRank]'s rule, vying for the scraps of power and a seat in the books of history. Only one can sit on the Dragon Throne and fulfill the will of Heaven."

 country_history_CHK: "The $town$ of [ShowLocationName('cahokia')] has developed a complex society, that revolves around the exploitation of the fertile agricultural lands of the valley around it, and the ruling of the priests that have organized the construction of temples on top of it. The culture of [ShowCultureName('cahokia_culture')] has also spread to the surrounding lands, structuring a vast territority.\n\nHowever, challenges may arise to our people - May we be able to further develop and organize our society, or shall this progress be lost and forgotten forever?"

 country_history_CSU: "The high volcanoes and fast rivers of the Andes Mountains hide and nourish the Sacred Valley of the Incas, where we, the sons of the Sun, dwell in the magnificent city of [ShowLocationName('qusqu')] as we prepare for the glorious future that awaits us.\n\nAfter years of consolidation and politics, the time has come for our people to expand their influence outside our great valley, to defeat our enemies and to follow the paths of the mountains to each of the corners of this world. Are we ready to take on this destiny? Or will those who oppose us beat us before we reach our prime?"

 country_history_DAI: "Born from the aftermath of the civil war of the Ngô dynasty in 968, the [GetCountry('DAI').GetLongName] has ever since struggled against the expanding sphere of influence of the the $chinese_group$ Empire to their north. Although part of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('middle_kingdom').GetName], the [GetCountry('DAI').GetCulture.GetName] people had to defend their lands from [GetCountry('CHI').GetCulture.GetName] invaders on multiple occasions.\n\nAtop of external threats, the [GetCountry('DAI').GetFlavorRank] also faces the issues of a highly decentralized state with [ShowEstatePrivilegeName('peasants_autonomous_villages')] and a volatile court life where hostile actors seek to take over the [GetCountry('DAI').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne.\n\nDespite all these challenges, [GetCountry('DAI').GetNameWithNoTooltip] finds itself in an opportunistic situation as the [GetCountry('CHA').GetLongName] finds itself surrounded by enemies and is ripe for the taking while [GetCountry('KHM').GetName] is facing internal decay at every front. The ascension of the [GetCountry('DAI').GetFlavorRank] to a dominant Empire of [ShowRegionName('indochina_region')] is at hand!"

 country_history_DAN: "The [GetCountry('DAN').GetLongName] sees itself in quite a precarious situation. During the rule of the last [GetCharacter('dan_chistopher_ii').GetName], great parts of the country were mortgaged to prominent members of the [ShowCultureName('danish')] and [ShowCultureGroupName('german_group')] [ShowEstateTypeName('nobles_estate')], the [GetCountry('SLV').GetLongName] was forced to be separated from the king's lands, and even the territory of [GetCountry('SKE').GetName] had to be sold to the [GetCountry('SWE').GetLongName].\n\n[GetCharacter('dan_chistopher_ii').GetNameWithNoTooltip] was dethroned by [GetCharacter('shl_gerhard_iii_holstein_rendsburg').GetName] when he installed his own nephew [GetCharacter('dan_valdemar_iii').GetName], only to be brought back again after a while as a puppet king. Since [GetCharacter('dan_chistopher_ii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s death, [GetCharacter('shl_gerhard_iii_holstein_rendsburg').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] has de facto been the ruler of [GetCountry('DAN').GetNameWithNoTooltip].\n\nIt will not be easy to overcome this situation, but [GetCountry('DAN').GetAdjective] people are resilient and resolute, and [GetCharacter('dan_valdemar_atterdag').GetName], son of [GetCharacter('dan_chistopher_ii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is already preparing his moves to recover the authority of the [GetCountry('DAN').GetFlavorRank]."

 country_history_DHM: "The [GetCountry('DHM').GetLongName] is no ordinary lordship, but a palatine state under the [GetCountry('ENG').GetLongName], where the Prince-Bishop rules with near-regal authority. Entrusted with powers to raise armies, mint coinage, and administer justice, the Bishop of Durham acts as a temporal prince over his Northumbrian domain.\n\nFor generations, this exceptional autonomy has allowed the bishops to guard the northern frontier from [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjective] raids, their fortified seat at [ShowLocationName('durham')] a bastion of royal loyalty amidst the marches.\n\nYet the times are uncertain. The border grows restless, [GetCountry('SCO').GetName] remains hostile, and even amongst the clergy, murmurs of reform and ambition stir. Though cloaked in the robes of the Church, the Palatinate of Durham stands as a political creature — and one that may yet rise to play a greater role in the affairs of the realm.\n\nWill the bishopric remain a quiet corner of royal service, or could it become a power in its own right, a great northern kingdom in all but name?"

 country_history_DLH: "A series of swift and legendary conquests in the last century gave birth to our great [GetCountry('DLH').GetLongName]. With territories under our jurisdiction that span from [ShowRegionName('deccan_region')] to the fertile fields of [ShowLocationName('lahore')], none other has dared measure up to the prestige and status of our accomplishments.\n\nHowever, it has become apparent that we have overextended our authority across such a big [GetCountry('DLH').GetFlavorRank] that it is nowadays quite difficult to control. Our enemies are many, and they covet to undo our great heritage. To the east, our subjects in [ShowAreaName('bengal_area')] have started questioning their masters, while our southern territories have long disputed our hold over them. And the [ShowReligionAdjective('hindu')] countries of Southern $india$ may further entrench their resistance to our rule, led by the rising power of [GetCountry('VIJ').GetName].\n\nWe trust the guidance of [GetCharacter('dlh_muhammad_bin_tughluq').GetName], whose watchful eye may safeguard our lands and prevent our downfall..."

 country_history_DMS: "The [GetCountry('DMS').GetLongName] lies in the rugged southwestern reaches of Ireland. Though far from [ShowLocationName('dublin')], it is no remote backwater — it is ruled by [GetCharacter('dms_maurice_fitzgerald').GetName], 1st Earl of Desmond, head of the southern branch of the mighty [ShowDynastyName('fitzgerald_dynasty')], and one of the most powerful lords in all of [ShowRegionName('ireland_region')].\n\nGranted his earldom in 1329, he carved out a semi-independent domain from the Gaelic chiefs of [GetCountry('THO').GetName] and the English crown authority of [GetCountry('PLE').GetName].\n\nThe Earldom is marked by shifting alliances, rival marcher barons, and persistent tension with both Dublin and London. As English royal power wanes in the west, we may seize the opportunity to assert autonomy, play the Gaelic clans against each other, or even claim kingship in all but name.\n\nWill Desmond become a linchpin of a new Hiberno-Norman resurgence? Or will it be swallowed by the tide of Gaelic reconquest and the feuds of rival dynasties?"


 country_history_ENG: "The English crown is still reeling from a treacherous rebellion which resulted in the underhanded murder of [GetCharacter('eng_edward_ii').GetShortName] just ten years ago. Although the ringleaders were executed, several co-conspirators have been granted mercy in the name of peace.\n\nMeanwhile, his surviving son [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortName] has already proven himself to be a capable young ruler, and is making bold designs on the [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjective] throne — a throne which is his birthright as the grandson of a [ShowDynastyName('capet_dynasty')] king.\n\nIn the north, our misguided stooge [GetCountry('SBL').GetName] weakly contends for the [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjective] crown, while our loyal vassals maintain a tight grip on the governments of [GetCountry('WLS').GetName], [GetCountry('PLE').GetName], and [GetCountry('AQN').GetName].\n\nHow shall we brave the turbulent years to come? Will we cross the channel and become a continental power, or look to the seas for global dominion?"

 country_history_ERE: "Founded by [GetCharacter('ere_eretna').GetName], an Ilkhanid officer of Uyghur origin, this Beylik state emerged after his victory at the Battle of Karanbük against Mongol warlords. Declaring independence from his former overlords, Eretna became sultan and earned the nickname Köse Peyghamber, 'the Beardless Prophet', for his prosperous reign. $anatolia_desc$"

 country_history_ETH: "The [GetCountry('ETH').GetLongName] is an ancient realm rich with history and traditions.

Its beauty is captivated by golden sunsets on the Simien Mountains.\n\n[GetCountry('ETH').GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s enchanting tapestry weaves diverse ethnic groups like the [ShowCultureName('amhara')], [ShowCultureName('afar_culture')], and [ShowCultureName('tigre')]. United in trials, it remains resilient like the ancient baobab tree, enduring through time.\n\nInspired by ancient origins, [GetCountry('ETH').GetNameWithNoTooltip] cherishes legendary unions like the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. The legacy of their son Menelik, the first member of the [ShowDynastyName('solomonid_dynasty')] dynasty, echoes through time, connecting this land to ancient Israelites.\n\nThrough the years, [GetCountry('ETH').GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s epic tale unfolds, shaped by destiny and the unwavering spirit of its people. Triumphs and tribulations weave a rich tapestry of life's ebb and flow.\n\nHowever, this nation stands as a realm encircled by adversaries eagerly waiting to seize any opportunity to strike.

 country_history_EWY: "Nestled in the borderlands between [ShowAreaName('wales_area')] and the heartlands of the [GetCountry('ENG').GetLongName], the [GetCountry('EWY').GetLongName] holds a vital strategic position as one of the marcher lordships charged with securing the realm's western frontier.\n\nThe current ruler, [GetCharacter('eng_bartholomew_burghersh_the_elder').GetName], is a loyal servant of the Crown and a veteran of both war and court. A trusted retainer of [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortName], he has proven himself not only on the battlefield but also as a royal envoy and administrator, serving at times as Constable of Dover and Warden of the Cinque Ports. His landed authority in the Marches gives him both wealth and reach, though he remains ever vigilant against the shifting loyalties and ambitions that define the region.\n\nWill the de Burghersh line maintain its favor with the Plantagenets and guard the Marches with honor? Or will the shifting tides of politics, war, and inheritance threaten to sweep away this marcher stronghold?"

 country_history_FLO: "The [GetCountry('FLO').GetAdjective] domain stands strong at the cusp of a new age! Our republic has stood the test of time and is located in a prime position to take advantage of our region's prosperity and affluence. Around us, rivaling states and potential allies all make their moves in a bid to influence and expand their territory in Italy.\n\nHowever, few are as well known for their aptitude in arts and cultural influence as our forums of thought in [ShowLocationName('florence')]. Under the guidance of a capable administration and an educated people, the coming century will elevate our people and have us shine brightly as pioneering innovators during a time of great enlightening."

 country_history_FRA: "The death of [GetCharacter('fra_charles_iv_capet').GetShortName] without a male heir in 1328 marked the end of [ShowDynastyName('capet_dynasty')] rule over the [GetCountry('FRA').GetLongName], resulting in the coronation of [GetCharacter('fra_philip_vi_valois').GetName], a relative from a former cadet branch of the dynasty. However, it has been contested by [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetName] of [GetCountry('ENG').GetName], on the pretext that while the [ShowHeirSelectionName('salic_law')] of [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip] forbids the passing of the throne to a female successor, it does not forbid the inheritance through a female line. As the son of [GetCharacter('eng_isabella_of_france').GetName], the last living sibling of [GetCharacter('fra_charles_iv_capet').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip], [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] might claim the throne of [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip] as his birthright.\n\nThe tension over both countries has worsened over the past years, as our hospitality of the exiled young ruler of [GetCountry('SCO').GetName], [GetCharacter('sco_david_ii').GetName], has enraged the [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] court, which supports the rival [GetCountry('SBL').GetName] claimant to the [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne. As a response, [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] has also recently granted refuge to [GetCharacter('eng_robert_iii_artois').GetName], who escaped calls to face trial in [ShowLocationName('paris')] for his attempts to seize the [GetCountry('ARS').GetLongName]. There are rumors that [GetCharacter('eng_robert_iii_artois').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is even encouraging the disgruntled [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] to press his claim to the throne of [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip] militarily.\n\nShould relations continue to deteriorate towards a boiling point, [GetCharacter('fra_philip_vi_valois').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] may require the support of [GetCharacter('fra_philip_vi_valois').GetHerHis] subjects, although more than one ambitious [ShowSubjectTypeName('appanage')] hailing from the old royal line may seize on the opportunity to demand greater privileges, proving a greater threat to the stability of the crown than any invading claimant. The upcoming years will be consequential for the future of [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip], having to face the external [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] menace and the proud [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] lords at once.

However, this might have been a poisonous gift, as it may now face ont only the opposition of its inhabitants, but also that of [GetCharacter('ara_peter_iv_arago').GetName], self-proclaimed sovereign of both islands.\n\nAnother challenge may arise from the east, as a network of possessions has created the conditions for a commercial dominance over the [ShowAreaName('black_sea_area')], centered around the port of [ShowLocationName('kaffa')]; although dangerous neighbors such as [GetCountry('VEN').GetName], [GetCountry('BYZ').GetName], or the [GetCountry('GLH').GetLongName] might be a threat.\n\nRelying on our numerous [ShowBuildingTypeName('fondaco')] and wealthy bankers, will [GetCountry('GEN').GetNameWithNoTooltip] overcome these challenges?"

Under the [ShowDynastyName('gediminid_dynasty')] dynasty, the [GetCountry('LIT').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] people have tasted success in expanding their domain to envelop parts of the Kievan Rus'. However, growing pressure and an ongoing crusade spearheaded by the [GetCountry('TEU').GetLongName], the [GetCountry('LIV').GetLongName] and the [GetCountry('BOH').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [GetCountry('BOH').GetName] serve as a grave reminder that religious friction may yet contribute to their demise.

 country_history_MAC: "The [GetCountry('MAC').GetLongName], ruled by the ambitious [ShowDynastyName('mortimer_dynasty')] dynasty, is one of the most powerful marcher lordships straddling the border between [ShowAreaName('wales_area')] and the [GetCountry('ENG').GetLongName].\n\nOnce elevated to near-royal power, the late [GetCharacter('eng_roger_mortimer_1st_earl_of_march').GetName] held England in his grasp as its regent, a post he achieved by treacherously having [GetCharacter('eng_edward_ii').GetShortName] assassinated. But ambition proved fatal — he was overthrown in 1330 and executed, the Mortimer name forever blackened as a family of usurpers and traitors.\n\nNow, the young [GetCharacter('eng_roger_mortimer_2nd_earl_of_march').GetName], heir to the disgraced line, stands to inherit not only vast estates and marcher prestige, but also the heavy burden of a tarnished legacy. While his youth shields him for now, the English crown watches the little lord with a wary eye.\n\nWill the Mortimers fade into noble obscurity as mere landowners, or will they reclaim the high influence once wielded on both sides of the march?"

 country_history_MAJ: "[GetCharacter('maj_raden_wijaya').GetName] established the powerful [GetCountry('MAJ').GetLongName] across the coasts of [ShowRegionName('indonesia_region')]. After [GetCharacter('maj_raden_wijaya').GetHerHis] death, [GetCharacter('maj_jayanagara').GetName] assumed the royal duties, proving to be an ineffective leader, as [GetCharacter('maj_jayanagara').GetHerHis] rule was plagued with many internal and external strifes, as well as open rebellions that contested royal authority.\n\nFortunately, [GetCharacter('maj_jayanagara').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s assassination in 1328 left the reins of the country in the capable hands of [GetCharacter('maj_tribhuwana').GetName], as queen regent for [GetCharacter('maj_tribhuwana').GetHerHis] son, [GetCharacter('maj_hayam_wuruk').GetName].

 country_history_MLO: "The politics of the Italian Peninsula are a double-edged sword. Foes and friends, allies and rivals are but identities prescribed and rescinded as easily as the wine flows in a cup. The [GetCountry('MLO').GetAdjective] position in this hostile environment is quite advantageous. Centered around the strong urban center of [ShowLocationName('milano')], we may seek to project our strength on our newly conquered territories around us, whilst protecting against the traitors to the east and west.\n\nInternally, the rise of autonomous city-states will likely cause issues for our administration and the preservation of our sovereignty.

 country_history_MOR: "The [ShowRegionName('maghreb_region')] has witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties and one powerful [GetCountry('MOR').GetFlavorRank] after another, from the Idrisids to the Almoravids or the Almohads. This era of instability and uncertainty has ended under the [ShowDynastyName('marinid_dynasty')] dynasty and the rule of [GetCharacter('mor_abu_al_hasan_ali').GetName]. Through a careful balance of military might and diplomatic acumen, we have secured firm control within our borders.

 country_history_NAP: "The [GetCountry('NAP').GetLongName] stands at the crossroads of its troubled history. Born from the ambitions of powerful dynasties seeking dominion over the southern Italian lands, [GetCountry('NAP').GetNameWithNoTooltip] rises as a bastion of resilience and cultural fusion that extends from ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans, to the more recent dynasties of the Hauteville, Hohenstaufen, and Anjou, each leaving an indelible mark on its identity.\n\nIn the year 1337, the Kingdom finds itself under the rule of a visionary leader, [GetCountry('NAP').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]; a wise and just monarch known for his sagacity and keen judgment, he has navigated the intricate web of political alliances with finesse.

Born as a [ShowCultureName('basque')] march of the Carolingian Empire, the realm has witnessed the rise and fall of local dynasties and their replacement by [ShowCultureName('french')] ones that have made the fate of the realm gravitate towards the [GetCountry('FRA').GetLongName].\n\nWithout open paths of expansion, will the [GetCountry('NAV').GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] be able to resist their more powerful surrounding nations and recover its past glory?"

 country_history_NOV: "Originally founded by Slav and Norse people as #italic Holmgård#!, the 'new city' of [ShowLocationName('novgorod')] became the main political and economic center in the north of the lands inhabited by the Russian people. Fiercely independent, the [GetCountry('NOV').GetAdjective] council elects its [GetCountry('NOV').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] among neighboring rulers, although the true power is held by its people, who thrive thanks to the commercial routes linking the rich inland resource-gathering outposts with the Baltic and White Seas.\n\nHowever, in recent decades, the war with [GetCountry('SWE').GetName] has been almost a constant, nowadays halted after the creation of the buffer state of [GetCountry('ORE').GetName].

 country_history_PLE: "[GetCountry('PLE').GetName|U] stands as the last firm outpost of [GetCountry('ENG').GetName]'s authority in [ShowRegionName('ireland_region')].

In the years of living in the Gaelic wildlands, the earls have become entangled with the native [ShowCultureName('irish')] lords, and they drift further by the year.\n\nStill, Dublin remains a dignified center of [ShowCultureName('english')] governance, law, and trade. Its appointed lieutenants attempt to uphold the king's peace, while the impotent Parliament of Ireland gathers to enact statutes that struggle to reach beyond the stone walls of the castle.\n\nWill the Lordship of Ireland reclaim its former reach, asserting control over the whole island? Or will it remain a coastal remnant — besieged, shrinking, and increasingly irrelevant — as Gaelic lords and marcher earls divide the emerald isle between them?"

 country_history_POL: "For centuries, the [GetCountry('POL').GetLongName] has found itself amid dynastic successions, wars, and fluctuating borders. The current ruler, [GetCharacter('pol_casimir_iii_piast').GetName], started his energetic reign in 1333, but despite his unification attempts, many of the [GetCountry('POL').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] subjects remain defiant in an effort to safeguard their established autonomy against the new [GetCountry('POL').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s diplomatic moves.

 country_history_SER: "[GetCountry('SER').GetName] encompasses fertile lowlands and plains in the north, crisscrossed by the mighty Danube and Sava rivers. In the south, the landscape transforms into rugged, forested terrain and, eventually, the towering Dinaric Alps.\n\nThe realm emerged as a significant regional power under the [ShowDynastyName('nemanjic_dynasty')] dynasty. Founded by Stefan Nemanja in the 12th century, this royal lineage laid the foundations for a unified [GetCountry('SER').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] state, began to solidify its [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('christian')] [ShowReligionAdjective('orthodox')] identity, and sought to establish ecclesiastical autonomy. This effort culminated in 1219 when the [GetCountry('SER').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('orthodox')] Church gained independence.\n\nUnder the rule of Stefan 'the First-Crowned', [GetCountry('SER').GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s territorial expansion accelerated, and the acquisition of coastal regions on the [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('adriatic_sea_province')] secured access to maritime trade and introduced Western influences.

 country_history_TEU: "The glorious #italic Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem#!, also known as the [GetCountry('TEU').GetLongName], face their destiny on the stormy coasts of the Baltic Sea.

 country_history_irish_minors: "The Gaelic lords of Ireland rule over a land steeped in ancient tradition, where kingship is not merely a title but a bond between the ruler and the people. Though the High Kingship of Ireland has faded into little more than a symbolic memory, the dream of a single ruler uniting the island still lingers in the hearts of ambitious chieftains. The clans remain fiercely independent, their strength lying in their warriors and their deeply rooted customs, yet divided they stand vulnerable to both external foes and internal rivalries.\n\nTo the east, the encroaching presence of the Hiberno-Norman earls threatens their sovereignty, while across the sea, the kings of England and Scotland cast their gaze upon Irish shores. Yet, Ireland is no stranger to foreign ambition. Time and again, its people have resisted and endured. If a single Gaelic lord could rally the clans and rekindle the old ways of kingship, then perhaps the island could rise once more, not as a land of divided chieftains, but as a nation united under one ruler."

 country_history_anglo_irish_minors: "The great earldoms beyond the Pale are the inheritors of the Norman conquest yet already woven into the ways of Ireland. A century and a half after Strongbow's arrival, the Hiberno-Norman lords rule vast territories, building stone castles where once only ringforts stood, commanding warbands as fierce as any Gaelic chieftain's. Yet, while they still bear the names of their noble houses from England, France, and Wales, they have become something distinct: neither fully Irish nor wholly foreign.\n\nThough their walls are strong, their position is precarious. The authority of the English crown in Ireland is weak, and the lords have grown accustomed to ruling their lands as they see fit, bound more by local alliances and feuds than by loyalty to a distant king. Meanwhile, the Gaelic chieftains to the west grow bolder, reclaiming lost lands and challenging Norman rule. Without firm leadership, the lords risk falling into the same divisions that fractured the island before them. Yet, if one were to seize the moment—to restore strong governance or even claim dominion over Ireland itself—then the future might belong to them, and not to the kings of England or the rebel Gaels."

To succeed in unifying the Rus'once again, we need to overcome all these hurdles."

 country_history_france: "The [ShowRegionName('france_region')] stands contested between two great kingdoms. For decades, the [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjective] crown has struggled to consolidate authority over powerful vassals, while across the Channel the [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjective] kings threaten the territorial integrity of their [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] peers. The embers of past wars may yet be fanned into open conflict, the shadow of a new struggle that will come to define an age creeps on the horizon.\n\nThe decades ahead will test their resolve as the [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] armies of [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortName] threaten to march upon [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] soil. Alliances shift, and the great houses of [ShowDynastyName('valois_dynasty')] weigh loyalty against ambition."

 country_history_britain: "The region of [ShowRegionName('great_britain_region')] is divided between crowns and clans, its unity more a dream than a reality. The [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjective] kings rule from the south, their authority tempered by restless barons and the ambitions of old dynasties. In the north, the [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjective] [GetCountry('SCO').GetFlavorRank] stands proud and defiant, embroiled in a bloody civil war against [GetCountry('SBL').GetAdjective].\n\nThe reign of [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortName] promises both opportunity and danger. Border wars, and the unyielding rivalry between [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] and [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] will decide whether this island grows united under one banner or remains a land of two realms locked in perpetual contest."

 country_history_balkan: "The [ShowRegionName('balkan_region')] is a frontier between empires, faiths, and cultures. The waning authority of the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetAdjective] emperors has left the land vulnerable, and new powers rise to claim its fractured territories. Local lords, ambitious princes, and foreign Ghazi from [ShowRegionName('anatolia_region')] all see opportunity in the chaos.\n\nThe advance of the [ShowCultureGroupName('turkic_group')] peoples grows ever closer, and the coming decades will decide whether the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] legacy endures or is swept away by its contesting neighbors."

Accross these lands, the Empires of [GetCountry('MAL').GetName] and [GetCountry('KBO').GetName] control vast areas and the Saharan trade routes, while other peoples, such as the [ShowCultureName('mossi')], [ShowCultureName('hausa')] or [ShowCultureName('yoruba')] wait for their moment to consolidate their respective lands, and expand oer their neighbors."

 country_history_kongo: "The [ShowRegionName('kongo_region')] is a land of river kingdoms and forested heartlands, where clans and chieftains forge alliances through blood, trade, and war. In recent decades, ambitious rulers have begun to bind these lands into greater realms, each seeking to dominate the fertile valleys and control the flow of goods along the great river.\n\nThe balance of power remains fragile, and in the decades ahead, a single strong leader could unite the [GetCountry('KON').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] people, or plunge them into a cycle of endless rivalry, weakened and exploitable by outsiders."

 country_history_east_africa: "From the lands of the Nile to the coasts of [ShowRegionName('madagascar_region')]; from the ancient ports of [ShowRegionName('somalia_region')] to the [ShowRegionName('swahili_coast_region')]; a miriad of nations, big and small and with a more advanced or more primitive way of life, have confronted both the unforgiving Nature and their enemies that tried to subjugate them.

 country_history_caucasus: "The [ShowRegionName('caucasus_region')] has always been like a world of its own. Many empires have tried to conquer it, and failed. And even when they succeeded, they could not manage to completely erase its people's traditions and beliefs, for life at the foot of these mountains is harsh, and its people stubborn.\n\nThe last ones to try to exert their control over these regions where the [ShowCultureGroupName('mongolian_group')] of $genghis_khan_name$, and its successor states the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('ilkhanate').GetName] and the [GetCountry('GLH').GetLongName].
